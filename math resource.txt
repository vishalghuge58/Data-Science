Statistics Needed for Data Science

Statistics is a very broad field and has a lot of applications in many fields. It is a study of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing the data. 
The important topics are probability distributions, statistical significance, hypothesis testing, and regression.
Machine Learning also requires an understanding of Bayesian thinking.This concept is used in many machine learning algorithms.

These are the three steps to learn Statistics and Probability that is required for data science:

1. Core Statistical Concepts - Descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing, and regression.

2. Bayesian Thinking - Conditional probability, priors, posteriors, and maximum likelihood.

3. Intro to Statistical Machine Learning
